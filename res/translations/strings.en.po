Although there is agreement about something: upon release the intensity of the contained cold would have permanent repercussions for a large area. Gigantic fires would be extinguished, volcanos quelled and large bodies of water frozen solid. In less extreme environments permanent changes were also probable. Therefore it isn't recommended to drop the cold treasure. It should be thrown far off instead, while making sure there is no living being within the impact zone, if one is willing to risk the usage.

msgstr "Transcript to the lecture of Selen Ard'Ragorn in Bar'Glingal: 'It is said, this spell had its beginnings in the drinking holes of the Westgassen, but every other disreputable quarter is just as likely. Its most important ingredient is about a cask of terrible wine, the cheaper and more unbecoming, the more effective will be the essence. The art to distill this wine into pure essence is far more demanding than the simple brewery of an alchemist. Even more so to bind and conserve it, preventing its natural tendency to evaporate. This can only be accomplished by a master of Cerddor. Say, you manage to produce a vial of this ruby red, shimmering - well, not fluid, but also not exactly vapor - let's call it elixir. More challenges still lie ahead. The effective properties of the elixir are quick to dissipate. Therefore it has to be dribbled into the drink of the chosen victim within days. That is when you masters of infatuation and seduction can truly proof your worth. But take care not to drink of the concoction yourselves, for one taste will ensnare you to the tastes of wine and you will spend a full week on a bender. And as sure as day follows night, a dreadful agony will claim your head afterwards. You will lose knowledge of your best skill, two weeks worth of study just gone. Another word of warning: this spell is very complex. Should you try further spells during the same week, they will be far more difficult to perform.'"
